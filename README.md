# Neura – AI-Enhanced DeFi Aggregator on Polygon

![Neura Logo](./assets/logo.png)

## 📖 Overview
Neura is an AI-enhanced, automated DeFi aggregator designed for the Polygon ecosystem. It pools user funds into smart vaults that automatically rebalance across protocols like **Aave**, **QuickSwap**, and **Balancer** to deliver the highest sustainable yields. By fusing AI-driven strategy selection with transparent on-chain governance, Neura reduces risk, optimizes returns, and makes yield farming accessible to mainstream users.

---

## ✨ Features
- **AI-Driven Strategy Selection** – Learns from historical yield and risk data to predict and select optimal strategies.
- **Smart Vault Rebalancing** – Automatically reallocates funds to capture changing yield opportunities.
- **Risk Management** – Monitors impermanent loss, liquidation risk, and protocol health.
- **Transparent Governance** – Uses on-chain voting for key parameter changes.
- **Low-Cost Execution** – Built on Polygon for fast, inexpensive transactions.
- **Developer-Friendly API** – REST and WebSocket endpoints for integrations.

## 🏗 Architecture
```

User → Frontend (React/Next.js) → Neura API (Node.js) → Polygon Smart Contracts → DeFi Protocols (Aave, QuickSwap, Balancer)
↘ AI Engine (Python/ML) ↙

````
- **Frontend**: Built with React + Tailwind, connects via Web3 to contracts and Neura API.  
- **Backend/API**: Node.js/Express providing endpoints for vault data, yield history, and user analytics.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts manage deposits, vaults, and protocol interactions.  
- **AI Engine**: Off-chain ML models analyze historical yield patterns, market trends, and rebalance triggers.

## 🔗 Smart Contract Overview
| Contract          | Purpose                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| VaultManager.sol   | Creates & manages vaults, handles deposits  |
| StrategyRouter.sol | Routes funds to best strategies             |
| Governance.sol     | Handles voting & parameter adjustments      |
| TokenAdapter.sol   | Integrates with Aave/QuickSwap/Balancer     |

### Deployment Steps
1. Compile with Hardhat:  
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile


2. Deploy to Polygon testnet:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
   ```
3. Verify contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network mumbai <address>
   ```

## ⚙️ Integration Guide

### Frontend (React Example)

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import NeuraVaultABI from "./abis/VaultManager.json";

const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
const signer = provider.getSigner();
const vault = new ethers.Contract(vaultAddress, NeuraVaultABI, signer);
await vault.deposit(ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
```

### Backend (Node.js Example)

```javascript
const res = await fetch("https://api.neura.finance/v1/vaults", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
});
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);
```
